# Image-Captioning-with-GloVe-and-InceptionV3
Generating natural language captions for images combines computer vision and natural language processing. This project aims to automatically describe images using deep learning techniques. Such systems have applications in accessibility (e.g., image descriptions for visually impaired users), content creation, and multimedia analysis.
