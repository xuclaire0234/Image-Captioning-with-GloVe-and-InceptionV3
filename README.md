# Image-Captioning-with-GloVe-and-InceptionV3
Generating natural language captions for images combines computer vision and natural language processing. This project aims to automatically describe images using deep learning techniques. Such systems have applications in accessibility (e.g., image descriptions for visually impaired users), content creation, and multimedia analysis.

## 2. Background Knowledge

### 2.1 Computer Vision
- **InceptionV3**:
  - A convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
  - Used as a feature extractor to encode images into high-dimensional vectors.

### 2.2 Natural Language Processing
- **Word Embeddings (GloVe)**:
  - Pre-trained word vectors capturing semantic relationships between words.
  - Used to initialize the embedding layer for improved language understanding.

- **Sequence Modeling (LSTM)**:
  - Long Short-Term Memory networks handle sequential data and maintain long-term dependencies.
  - Essential for generating coherent captions word by word.

### 2.3 Encoder-Decoder Architecture
- **Encoder**:
  - InceptionV3 encodes images into fixed-size vectors.
- **Decoder**:
  - LSTM generates captions, predicting one word at a time conditioned on the image and previous words.

## 3. Dataset Preparation

### 3.1 Preprocessing
- Images resized to InceptionV3â€™s input dimensions (299x299).
- Pixel values normalized for efficient processing.
- Captions augmented with `startseq` and `endseq` tokens for sequence modeling.

### 3.2 Text Cleaning
- Removed punctuation and numbers.
- Converted captions to lowercase.
- Retained words appearing at least 5 times in the dataset.

### 3.3 Vocabulary
- Constructed a vocabulary from frequently occurring words in captions.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Feature Extraction
- Used **InceptionV3** to extract a fixed-size feature vector (`2048-d`) for each image.

### 4.2 Caption Generation Model
- **Embedding Layer**:
  - Initialized with pre-trained GloVe embeddings for word representation.
  
- **LSTM-based Decoder**:
  - Takes image features and word embeddings as inputs to generate captions.

### 4.3 Training
- **Loss Function**:
  - Categorical Cross-Entropy optimized word predictions.
  
- **Batch Processing**:
  - Custom data generator to yield batches of image features, input sequences, and target sequences.

## 5. Results and Evaluation

Metrics
Common metrics for evaluating image captioning:
- **BLEU Score**: Measures overlap between generated and ground-truth captions.
- **CIDEr**: Focuses on consensus in human-annotated captions.
- **ROUGE**: Measures n-gram overlap.
- **METEOR**: Considers synonyms and stemming for semantic matching.

## 6. Challenges
- Handling missing or unsupported image formats.
- Balancing vocabulary size while retaining caption diversity.
- Training efficiency with large datasets.

---

## 7. Future Work
- **GANs for Image Captioning**:
  - Explore adversarial training to improve caption quality.
  
- **Attention Mechanism**:
  - Implement attention to focus on specific image regions for better word generation.

- **Transformer Models**:
  - Experiment with Vision Transformers (ViT) or integrate pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT, BERT).

## 8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how pre-trained models like InceptionV3 and GloVe can be used effectively for image captioning. The model successfully generates captions, although there is room for improvement in diversity and accuracy. Future work can incorporate GANs, attention mechanisms, or transformer architectures to enhance the system further.
